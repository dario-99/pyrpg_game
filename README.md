# Introduction
The intention of the game it's to create a simple turn-based RPG similiar to the Final Fantasy series. More info of the game will be available in the docs folder.
As a recreational project mantained only by myself, no real schedule will be followed. I will only use spare time to develop this project.
The main goals of this project are:
    1. Become a better software engineer by implementing the architectural and design pattern studied during my degree
    2. Become a better python programmer
    3. Learn the pygame module
    4. Have fun!!
As a software engineer wannabe i will mainly focus on the documentation and trying to implement what i wrote.
The developing approach i will use it's for sure the iterative approach, creating a prototype and then refining trough iterations. Each iteration will eventually be available as a git branch.

## Folder structure
the project will start with 2 main folder, docs and src. The docs folder will contain a folder for each iteration containing the documentation produced for the current iteration of the project. For example a requirements analysis, goals and UML diagrams.
The src file will contain the python source code of the main application and the modules created. 
In the main section of the repository there will be also a requirements.txt file that will contain all the dependencies of the application.

## Running the game
Since the game it's in the early stages no instruction will be present here until the end of the first iteration.
The will it's to use a python virtual enviroment with the venv program. So with the requirements.txt file one can install the dependencies and run the game easily. Further in the developing cycle i will eventually study new ways to distribute the game as a self contained application.
